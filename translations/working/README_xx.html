<h2><a name="background"></a>Background</h2>

<p>Why write another unit converter?  There are plenty of them out
there.  Well, I couldn't find one that worked quite the way I
wanted.</p>

<p>With ConvertAll, you can combine the units any way you want.  If
you want to convert from inches per decade, that's fine.  Or from
meter-pounds.  Or from cubic nautical miles.  The units don't have to
make sense to anyone else.</p>

<p>Since I'm not in the software business, I'm making this program
free for anyone to use, distribute and modify, as long as it is not
incorporated into any proprietary programs.  If you like the software,
feel free to let others know about it.  And let me know what you think

  numbers.</li>

  <li>Options control the formatting of numerical results.</li>

  <li>The unit data includes over 500 units.</li>

the Free Software Foundation; either Version 2 of the License, or (at
your option) any later version.</p>

WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.  See the <tt>LICENSE</tt> file provided with
this program for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="sysreq"></a>System Requirements</h2>

<h3><a name="linux-sys"></a>Linux</h3>

<p>ConvertAll requires the following libraries:
<ul>
  <li>Qt (Version 4.1 or higher - see <a
      href="http://www.trolltech.com">Trolltech</a> for more
      information)</li>
  <li>Python (Version 2.3 or higher)</li>
  <li>PyQt (Version 4.0 or higher - see <a
    href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk">Riverbank</a>
    for more information)</li>
</ul></p>

<h3><a name="win-sys"></a>Windows</h3>

<p>Using the files provided in the binary distribution, ConvertAll
should run on any computer running Win 95, 98, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, or
7.</p>

<h2><a name="install"></a>Installation</h2>

<h3><a name="linux-inst"></a>Linux</h3>

<p>Extract the source files from the convertall tar file, then change to
the <tt>ConvertAll</tt> directory in a terminal.  For a basic
installation, simply execute the following command as root:  <tt>python
  install.py</tt></p>

<p>To see all install options, use: <tt>python install.py -h</tt></p>

<p>To install ConvertAll with a different prefix (the default is
<tt>/usr/local</tt>), use:  <tt>python install.py -p
  /prefix/path</tt></p>

<h3><a name="win-inst"></a>Windows</h3>

<p>Simply execute the downloaded installation file
(<tt>convertall-x.x.x-install.exe</tt>).  It will install the program
with its libraries and optionally create file associations and
shortcuts.</p>

<p>If you wish to modify the source code or write your own PyQt programs
for Windows, do not use the above procedure.  Instead, you need to
install <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> and the binary for <a
  href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk">PyQt</a>.  Then extract the
source code and data files from the Linux version (convertall tar file)
to a directory of your choice and execute the <tt>convertall.py</tt>
file.</p>

<h2><a name="using"></a>Using ConvertAll</h2>

<h3><a name="basics"></a>Basics</h3>

<p>Simply type a unit name in the "From Unit" edit window.  As you
type, the list below the window will scroll to show unit names which
are close matches.  Either type the complete unit abbreviation or unit
name or hit the return key to use the unit highlighted in the list.
Of course, clicking with the mouse on a unit in the list will also add
the unit to the edit window.  You may also use the up and down arrow
keys to select nearby units from the list.</p>

<p>Repeat the unit selection in the "To Unit" edit window.  When done,
if the units are compatible, you will see the numeric edit windows
below the unit lists activate.  A number may be entered into either
numeric window and the other window will display the conversion
result.</p>

<h3><a name="combine"></a>Combining Units</h3>

<p>The real strength of ConvertAll lies in its ability to combine
multiple units.  Simply type the unit names with an '*' or a '/'
between them.  This allows the entry of units such as "ft*lbf" or
"mi/hr".  The '^' symbol may be used for exponents, such as "ft^3" or
"ft*lbm/sec^2".  Negative exponents are allowed for units such as
"sec^-1" (per second), but may switch the multiplication or division
symbol ("ft*sec^-2" becomes "ft/sec^2").</p>

<p>Multiplication and division have the same precedence, so they are
evaluated left-to-right.  Parenthesis may also be used to group units in
the denominator.  So "m / sec / kg" can also be entered as "m / (sec *
kg)".  The version with parenthesis is probably less confusing.</p>

<p>The buttons below the unit lists ('X', '/', '^2', '^3') will also
place the operators after the unit nearest to the cursor.  The
exponent keys will replace the unit's exponent.</p>

<p>Similarly, clicking on a unit from the list generally replaces the
unit nearest the cursor.</p>

<p>The "Clear Unit" button below the operator buttons may be used to
empty the unit edit window to allow a new unit to be entered.</p>

<h3><a name="shortcut"></a>Shortcuts</h3>

<p>When typing unit names, spaces are ignored, so they may be skipped.
It is also generally ignored if a plural form of the unit name is
typed.  When a partially typed unit is highlighted in the list,
hitting enter will complete the name.  Also, hitting the tab key will
complete the name and move to the next entry field.</p>

<p>The "Recent Unit" button opens a menu of recently used units and
unit combinations.  The current unit combination is replaced with any
selections from this menu.</p>

<p>The number to be converted may be entered in either the "From" or
"To" unit side.  Standard or scientific notation may be used, or an
expression including the normal math operators (+, -, *, /, **) and
parenthesis may be entered.</p>

<h3><a name="finder"></a>Unit Finder</h3>

<p>The unit finder can be used to filter units by type and/or search for
units using a text string.  It displays a separate unit list in a new
window.  The list will be updated based on the filter and search string
entries.</p>

<p>Buttons near the bottom of the finder window add the selected unit to
the units in the main window.  The "Replace" buttons replace an entire
combined unit with the selection.  The "Insert" button changes only the
part of a combined unit that is active (at the cursor in the main
window).</p>

<h3><a name="options"></a>Options</h3>

<p>The "Options..." button allows for changing several default
settings.  These settings are automatically stored so that ConvertAll
will re-start with the settings last used.</p>

<p>The first options control the display of numerical results,
including the use of scientific notation and the number of decimal
places.  Be cautious about setting the number of decimal places to a
low value, which can result in a significant loss of accuracy.  Six
places or higher is recommended (eight is the default).</p>

<p>There is an option to set the number of recent units to be saved.
Setting it to zero will disable the Recent Unit buttons.</p>

<p>There is an option to hide the operator text option buttons (x, /,
^2, ^3, Clear Unit and Recent Unit).  These can be hidden to save space
if the keyboard will be used to enter the operators.</p>

<p>Buttons are also included on the options dialog to control the colors
of the text fields.</p>

<h3><a name="nonlinear"></a>Non-Linear Conversions</h3>

<p>The conversion of some units is non-linear.  Examples of these
include the Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales (due to an
offset zero point) and the American Wire Gauge (logarithmic).  The
non-linear units are labeled as such in the comments column (located
to the right of the "Type" column).</p>

<p>These units can be converted only when they are not combined with
other units or used with an exponential operator.  Otherwise the
conversion would not be meaningful.</p>

<h3><a name="cmdline"></a>Command Line Usage</h3>

<p>Conversions may be done from the command line (Linux or DOS console)
without invoking the graphical interface.  Enter the command
("convertall" on Linux, "convertall_dos" from the Windows binary), the
number, the from unit and the to unit (separated by spaces) to do the
conversion.  Unit names containing spaces should be surrounded by
quotes.  Or, to be prompted for each unit entry, use the "-i" option
("convertall -i" on Linux, "convertall_dos -i" from Windows).</p>

<p>After the conversion is done, ConvertAll will prompt for a new number
to do the same conversion.  Or "n" can be entered to start a new
conversion, "r" to reverse the conversion or "q" to quit.</p>

<p>For a more detailed list of options, use the "-h" option ("convertall
-h" on Linux, "convertall_dos -h" on Windows).</p>
