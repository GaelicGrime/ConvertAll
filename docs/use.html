            <h1>How to Use ConvertAll</h1>

            </ul>

            <h2><a name="basics"></a>Basics</h2>

            <p>Simply type a unit name in the "From Unit" edit window.  As you
            type, the list below the window will be filtered to show only
            matching units.  Matching unit names contain words starting with
            the words that are typed.  Either type the complete unit
            name/abbreviation or hit the return key to use the unit
            highlighted (blue letters) in the list.  Of course, clicking with
            the mouse on a unit in the list will also add the unit to the edit
            window.  You may also use the up and down arrow keys to highlight
            nearby units from the list.</p>

            <p>Repeat the unit selection in the "To Unit" edit window.  When
            done, if the units are compatible, the numeric edit windows below
            the unit lists will activate.  A number may be entered into either
            numeric window and the other window will display the conversion
            result.</p>

            <h2><a name="combine"></a>Combining Units</h2>

            <p>The real strength of ConvertAll lies in its ability to combine
            multiple units.  Simply type the unit names with an '*' or a '/'
            between them.  This allows the entry of units such as "ft * lbf"
            or "mi / hr".  The '^' symbol may be used for exponents, such as
            "ft^3" or "ft * lbm / sec^2".  Negative exponents are allowed for
            units such as "sec^-1" (per second), but may switch the
            multiplication or division symbol ("ft * sec^-2" becomes "ft /
            sec^2").</p>

            <p>Multiplication and division have the same precedence, so they
            are evaluated left-to-right.  Parenthesis may also be used to
            group units in the denominator.  So "m / sec / kg" can also be
            entered as "m / (sec * kg)".  The version with parenthesis is
            probably less confusing.</p>

            <p>The buttons below the unit text boxes can also be used to add
            operators to the active unit that is closest to the cursor.  The
            Square and Cube buttons will add or replace exponents.  The
            Multiply and Divide buttons will add "*" and "/" operators.</p>

            <p>Similarly, clicking on a unit from the list generally replaces
            the unit nearest the cursor.</p>

            <p>The "Clear Unit" button below the operator buttons may be used
            to empty the unit edit window to allow a new unit to be
            entered.</p>

            <p>The "Filter List" button can be used to show only one type of
            unit in the list.  Note that this doesn't show units that could be
            combined to form a type.</p>

            <h2><a name="nonlinear"></a>Non-Linear Conversions</h2>

            <p>The conversion of some units is non-linear.  Examples of these
            include the Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales (due to an
            offset zero point) and the American Wire Gauge (logarithmic).  The
            non-linear units are labeled as such in the comments column.</p>

            <p>These units can be converted only when they are not combined
            with other units or used with an exponential operator.  Otherwise
            the conversion would not be meaningful.</p>

            <h2><a name="shortcut"></a>Shortcuts</h2>

            <p>When typing unit names, spaces are ignored, so they may be
            skipped.  It is also generally ignored if a plural form of the
            unit name is typed.  For squared and cubed units (positive
            exponents of 2 or 3) the "^" symbol does not need to be typed.</p>

            <p>When a partially typed unit is highlighted in the list (blue
            lettering), hitting enter will complete the name.  The up an ddown
            arrow keys can be used to highlight nearby units in the list prior
            to hitting enter.  The unit closet to the cursor will be
            replaced.</p>

            <p>The "Recent Unit" button opens a menu of recently used units
            and unit combinations.  The current unit combination is replaced
            with any selections from this menu.</p>

            <p>The tab key can be used to cycle between the "From" and "To"
            unit test boxes and the "From" and "To" number editors.</p>

            <p>The number to be converted may be entered in either the "From"
            or "To" unit side.  Standard or scientific notation may be used,
            or an expression including the normal math operators (+, -, *, /,
            **) and parenthesis may be entered.</p>

            <h2><a name="options"></a>Options</h2>

            <p>The "Options..." button allows for changing several default
            settings.  These settings are automatically stored so that
            ConvertAll will re-start with the settings last used.</p>

            <p>The first options control the display of numerical results,
            including the use of scientific notation and the number of decimal
            places.  Be cautious about setting the number of decimal places to
            a low value, which can result in a significant loss of accuracy.
            Six places or higher is recommended (eight is the default).</p>

            <p>There is an option to set the number of recent units to be
            saved.  Setting it to zero will disable the Recent Unit buttons.
            Another option will automatically load the most recent previous
            units at startup.</p>

            <p>There are options to hide the operator text buttons (first
            row), and the unit buttons (second row).  These can be hidden to
            save space if the keyboard will be used to enter the
            operators.</p>

            <p>Buttons are also included on the options dialog to control the
            colors of the text fields.</p>

            <h2><a name="cmdline"></a>Command Line Usage</h2>

            <p>Conversions may be done from the command line (Linux or DOS
            console) without invoking the graphical interface.  Enter the
            command ("convertall" on Linux, "convertall_dos" from the Windows
            binary), the number, the from unit and the to unit (separated by
            spaces) to do the conversion.  Unit names containing spaces should
            be surrounded by quotes.  Or, to be prompted for each unit entry,
            use the "-i" option ("convertall -i" on Linux, "convertall_dos -i"
            from Windows).</p>

            <p>After the conversion is done, ConvertAll will prompt for a new
            number to do the same conversion.  Or "n" can be entered to start
            a new conversion, "r" to reverse the conversion or "q" to
            quit.</p>

            <p>For a more detailed list of options, use the "-h" option
            ("convertall -h" on Linux, "convertall_dos -h" on Windows).</p>
